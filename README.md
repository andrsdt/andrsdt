# Hi there 👋 I'm Andrés

I'm a software engineer mainly interested in backend/DB development (Django, Flask, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB...), although I'm also interested in many other fields of computer science. I'm always learning new concepts to apply in my side projects 🚀

- 🌍  I'm based in Seville, Spain
- 📩  You can contact me at [andresdt@pm.me](mailto:andresdt@pm.me)
- 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects
- 🎼  I enjoy learning music theory in my free time
- ⌨️  Fun fact: I like to build weird custom keyboards
